What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge notices the differences between a file you edited in the current branch and a file that was fetched and does the ">>> === <<<" thing in the file to show the differences.
A rebase updates the start of the branch to another state which happened after the initial branch.

One of the main differences is that merge affects the files while rebase only works with the branch itself.
